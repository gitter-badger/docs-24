## Clock Genes

Inside of each of us, there is an internal processor. Maybe a processor is a stretch, but if the analogy is not unlike a mechanical watch.

Think of it like oscillations that happen throughout the day.

We are all familiar with the circadian rhythm -- the 24 hours cycle that all animal live by and dictates their sleep.

What we are learning is that the process is actually much more complex than that.

Within each us of us, there are living cells. And within those cells, there components of a circadian clock. Regardless of the purpose of the cell, the clock gene purpose is the same. It works as an internal timing system and control rhythms in our physiology and our behavior.

These genes contribute to the regulation of our sleep and our energy levels through out the day

## Ayurveda Clock

Ayurveda is a holistic system between body, spirit, and mind that helps create natural harmony by ways of reconnecting our body to the natural circadian rhythms.

Traditional practices involve pragmatic observations dating over 5000 years of nature practices help align your body's internal clock with the rising and setting of the sun.

The Ayurvedic Clock divides the day into six four-hour cycles. Following this schedule can help keep your mind and body in tune with your natural circadian clock that exists in every living cell.

Ayurvedic practices ordinate in India, dating back to over 5000 years, and is still practiced today by many all over the world.

- 6 am - 10 am - Kapha (Water)
- 10 am - 2 pm - Pitta (Fire)
- 2 pm - 6 pm - Vata (Wind)

- 6 pm - 10 pm - Kapha (Water)
- 10 pm - 2 am - Pitta (Fire)
- 2 am - 6 am - Vata (Wind)

The problem I immediately start to see with this schedule is that every time I've seen it mentioned, it always assumes this same exact schedule, starting at 6am. But I have to wonder, is 6am a natural time, or is this generalized to help fit a particular area?

Living in Seattle, I have struggled to keep a schedule.  Of course the rain and cloud cover makes it difficult to get sunlight in the morning (although I understand even covered exposure is good for you). As the seasons change, so does the time you are exposed to early sunlight changes. This is normal for most places, depending on where you are relative to the equator, and Seattle just happens to be located in an area where the sun rises and sets at a considerably wide range through the year.

So to break this down and modify it to work around the suns schedule, instead of some random 6am schedule.

6 am - 10 am - Kapha (Water)
10 am - 2 pm - Pitta (Fire)
2 pm - 6 pm - Vata (Wind)
6 pm - 10 pm - Kapha (Water)
10 pm - 2 am - Pitta (Fire)
2 am - 6 am - Vata (Wind)

## Modern Clock

Modern life is not a holistic system; it is a chaotic system.

Even though many of us know we keep bad habits and that our routines fight against what is best for us, many struggle to follow even the simplest of routines. We all seem to need a little help getting through the day. Despite our best efforts, waking up at the break of dawn isn't always possible.

Moreover, what is daylight for someone in one part of the world on one particular day might be 7:00am, that meteoric changes.

CalendarDiety is a marriage of these two concepts.

### 04:53 The Daily (Learning) Routine

- Neural plasticity (the ability for the brain to change itself) can be optimized -- brain can change itself just by making a decision
  - We have ability to direct changes in ways that will survive us better
  - Behaviors and routines can motivate and active plasticity

### 07:13 Plasticity Is NOT the Goal

- Plasticity is just the state for our nervous system to change
- "This pill or this practice gives you plasticity" is not realistic
  - Plasticity is just change -- what are you trying to change?
  - Some goals are specific, general, or temporary
  - To achieve change, brain needs right conditions to be plastic.
- The goal is to figure out how to access plasticity
  - And the direct plasticity to specific goal or change
  - Plasticity is not required to meet these goals, but can be helpful if you're unhappy with aspects of your life and want to shift

### 09:26 No Obligation To Change

- There are some reasons you might not want to change, but for the majority of us, leveraging plasticity mechanisms is possible for anyone.

### 09:59 Practical Plasticity Language

- Behaviors can be summed up in categories of routines:
  - Yearly Routines
  - Monthly Routines
  - Daily Routines
- Type of plasticity
  - Long term - usually what's refereed to when talking about plasticity. What a child does to learn, and what adults can use to reach large goals
  - Mid term - not embedded for too long, long studying for a test things you won't want to hang onto forever, like learning a new city layout on vacation
- Systems that are available for plasticity an their routines
  - Our autonomous cycle is around 12 hours long
    - We're sleep for portion of the day, and awake for portion of the day
    - The trigger for plasticity and learning happens during high focused and alert steps (not when you're asleep)
    - The resulting reconfiguration happens during sleep
      - You trigger the change, then during sleep your brain rewires and you get the change

### 13:37 Pillars of Neuroplasticity

- The automatic arousal system
  - system of neurons in brain and body that wake us up and make us alert
    - When not accessing that system, we cannot access plasticity we cannot optimize our brain
    - If we are not sleeping well, we are not resting well, we cannot reconfigure our brain
 
 ### 15:16 My Daily Routine: Chronotype Management
  - Everyone has different chronotypes, not everyone's system might be shorter than 24 hours
    - Many people don't meat their natural cycle, but things we can do to help
    - Means getting light in later afternoon can help you stay up a little later.
    - 17:20 Plasticity of the Wake-Sleep Circuit: Morning Light
      - Get sunlight first sunlight in the day
      - Connections between "special cells" and circadian clock are plastic throughout lifetime can remove and reinforce connections between your eye and these clocks every day
      - Wake-sleep cycle
        - between clock and adrenal glands triggers Cortisol
        - If groggy in the morning, viewing light early
        - But if you few frequently then connection become primed and anticipate light, you naturally wake up earlier
        - Get regular light -- even if especially tired or overcast -- system is plastic and will shift either way
          - Can use a bright light to simulate light
          - But want to try to get it on a regular basis

### 19:09 Delay Caffeine

- Delay intact of caffeine to help with alertness
  - Caffeine suppress Adenosine and makes us feel awake
  - When consume right when waking, caffeine will override natural Adenosine receptors and causes mid morning crash
   - If caffeine is occupying receptors, then wont' have natural reaction
   - If you delay caffeine, you can capture and reinforce neural circuit that exists between clock
   - Then you can use the caffeine as a natural lift, as opposed as being used to wake up you up.
   - "completing antagonist"
   - Wants circuits to be functioning in a particular way so the caffeine ads more alertness
- This all helps naturally wake up in the morning

### 22:57 High Alertness, Linear Tasks/Learning

- When alert is highest, best for making a strategy
  - Duration, path and outcome
    - Very good at when well rested and focus
- Creatively best when relaxed and kind of drowsy
- Mid morning is peak focus time for most people
